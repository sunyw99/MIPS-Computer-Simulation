# MIPS-Computer-Simulation
This is a term project from the course VE370 Intro to Computer Organization. In this project, both single cycle and pipelined implementation of MIPS computer are modelled using Verilog. A subset of MIPS instruction set are implemented, including:
* The memory-reference instructions load word (*lw*) and store word (*sw*)
* The arithmetic-logical instructions *add*, *addi*, *sub*, *and*, *andi*, *or*, and *slt*
* The jumping instructions branch equal (*beq*), branch not equal (*bne*), and jump (*j*)
